sonic extension to Arista products to allow sonic APIs on any arista device
- can we do this for veos?
- cEOS model
Would like to keep twin peaks in consideration for Sonic

# For DC to Azure
Need a CVD type doc Arista's validated design - help accelerate sales cycle
100G for ER - 
10G and lower go through ER partner
100G (particularly around Financials) - directly into Azure
Lots of opportunity to engage on 100G architecture
Can have macsec on the connectivity - on roadmap for support in Azure
QinQ for Jerhico on platforms that support Macsec
100G skus can use dot1q - many customers prefer dot1q for simplicity, but azure was using it internally, so need QinQ


Global reach for ER - allows MSFT backbone to connect ER endpoints
Unify connectivity models
No intelligent path selection yet

# VWAN
Killer scenario for SDWAN is Office 365 - API from virtual wan 
Need to support O365 API
All office traffic goes directly to Internet
Grab prefixes for O365 and send it to the Internet, other stuff goes over VWAN

# Another key scenario is running multiple clouds to transfer data
connecting clouds together to migrate S3 data


# ExpressRoute monitoring 
How to monitor the solution 
Cloud Tracer
Monitoring best practices should be part of AVD
